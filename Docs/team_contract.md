## B. Team Procedures:
The agenda for each meeting will be set by the leader for the week before each meeting, and members will be reminded 
an hour before the meeting with a discord message. The leader is expected to keep discussion on track. The team will 
meet only when all members are present, with the exception of during class.

## C. Team Participation:
Each story is given a difficulty rating that will be taken into account when tasks are chosen. These stories will 
be assigned at our group meeting to a member who chooses to take them, making sure that everyone is 
comfortable with their workload. To encourage team members to participate we will have a section of every meeting 
for people to bring up new ideas and discuss new features.

## D. Personal Accountability:
Everyone will attend the team meeting, with the expectation of calling in within 5 minutes of the start time 
unless previously noted. Each team member will additionally be expected to update the group on their work since 
the last meeting.

Every team member should aim to complete their assigned work by a week from its assignment, however exceptions may 
be made for larger tasks. Members who do not complete their work may receive a sub-par peer review.

The only required communication is during the update and new work section of our meeting, 
however any additional communication about time frames for work, finished commits, or large changes to the code 
should also be communicated.

Team members are expected to commit to finishing any work assigned, however you are a person before a student -- 
and so emergencies happen. If a task is pulled and is discovered to be much more difficult than expected, 
assignment can be reassessed at the next meeting.

## E. Consequences of breach of contract:
Any infractions will be discussed in the meeting between team members, and will be remembered when the time 
for peer evaluations comes. Persistent infractions of the rules defined above can and will result in a loss of 
25% of the peer evaluation grade, and a discussion will be had between the team members with faculty oversight.

##B. Team Procedures:
1. Method for setting and following meeting agendas (Who will set each agenda? When? How will team
members be notified/reminded? Who will be responsible for the team following the agenda during a
team meeting?): The agenda will be set by the leader for the week before each meeting, and members will be reminded an hour before
the meeting with a discord message. The leader is expected to keep discussion on track.

2. Method of record keeping (Who will be responsible for recording and disseminating minutes? How
and when will the minutes be disseminated? Where will all agendas and minutes be stored?): Rather than using
minutes, we will be recording our sessions on Google Meet and sharing them in Google Drive.

3. Procedures in the absence of a team member: (will the team meet with one member absent, or must
all members be present?): The team will meet only when all members are present, with the exception of during class.

##C. Team Participation:
6. Strategies to ensure cooperation and equal distribution of tasks: Each story is given a difficulty rating
that will be taken into account when tasks are chosen. These stories will be assigned at our group meeting to a
member who chooses to take them, making sure that everyone is comfortable with their workload.

7. Strategies for encouraging/including ideas from all team members (team maintenance): To encourage team members
to participate we will have a section of every meeting for people to bring up new ideas and discuss new features.

8. Strategies for keeping on task (task maintenance): 

#D. Personal Accountability:
1. Expected individual attendance, punctuality, and participation at all team meetings: Everyone will attend
the team meeting, with the expectation of calling in within 5 minutes of the start time unless previously noted.
Each team member will additionally be expected to update the group on their work so far since the last meeting.

2. Expected level of responsibility for fulfilling team assignments, timelines, and deadlines: Every team member
should aim to complete their assigned work by a week from its assignment, however exceptions may be made for larger
tasks. Members who do not complete their work may receive a sub-par peer review.

3. Expected level of communication with other team members: The only required communication is during the update
and new work section of our meeting, however any additional communication about time frames for work, finished
commits, or large changes to the code should also be communicated.

4. Expected level of commitment to team decisions and tasks. Team members are expected to commit to finishing
any work assigned, however you are a person before a student -- and so emergencies happen. If a task is pulled
and is discovered to be much more difficult than expected, assignment can be reassessed at the next meeting.

##E. Consequences of breach of contract:
What procedures and penalties do you wish to implement in the case of "slackers" or team members who
deviate from your Team Contract? You basically have two options here: 1.) No Peer Evaluation or 2.)
Peer Evaluation. Either option is acceptable to me, but I strongly advise you implement Peer
Evaluation so that you have a mechanism in place if problems arise.

2. Peer Evaluation: If you would like some form of peer evaluation, specify the following
statement: Our team will conduct peer evaluation as part of this project.
• You cannot change any aspect of the team contract, particularly the "Procedures" section, once
the signed contract has been turned in to me. Therefore, be VERY SPECIFIC on the Procedures
section and spend some time thinking about this section. The only way I will accept a change to
your Team Contract is if ALL members of your team sign and date a written amendment to your
initial agreement.

• I will provide notification via e-mail to any student whose grade may be lowered as a result of the
peer evaluation.

1. Policies for handling infractions of any of the obligations of this team contract: Any infractions will
be discussed in the meeting between team members, and will be remembered when the time for peer evaluations comes.


2. Policies for handling persistent infractions: Persistent infractions of the rules defined above
can and will result in a loss of 25% of the peer evaluation grade, and a discussion will be had between the
team members with faculty oversight.

##F. Certification by team members:
In appending your signatures below, you are stating that:

a) You participated in formulating the standards, roles, and procedures of this contract;

b) You have agreed to abide by these terms and conditions of this contract;

c) You understand that you will be subject to the consequences specified above and may be subject to
reduction in overall course grade in the event that you do not fulfill the terms of this contract.

##G. Acceptance of contract by faculty:
This contract does not take effect until it is accepted by the supervising faculty of senior design as
evidenced by their signatures below:

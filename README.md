# Choose your own Adventure Game (CYOA-Gen)
## Authors: Aaron Chen, Drew Hiller, Evan Quist

Our team uses a system for deciding priorities and estimates 
based around unit-less measurements. For estimates of time we rate each
story on a scale of difficulty from 1 to 5 stars with 5 stars being the most
difficult of projects. Our priorities range similarly from 1 to 5, with 1
being the most important to be implemented quickly, and thus the highest
priority.
